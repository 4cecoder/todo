# Calendar Sync Feature Specifications

## Overview
The bilinear (bidirectional) sync system enables seamless integration between multiple calendar providers, allowing users to synchronize events across calendars while maintaining source attribution for all cloned events.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Calendar Integration
- Support for major calendar providers:
  - Google Calendar
  - Microsoft Outlook Calendar
  - Apple Calendar (via CalDAV)
  - Custom CalDAV/Calendars
- OAuth-based authentication for secure connections
- Ability to connect multiple calendars per user

### 2. Bidirectional Synchronization
- Real-time sync for immediate updates
- Scheduled sync options (every 15 minutes, hourly, daily)
- Manual sync trigger
- Incremental sync to minimize API calls and data transfer

### 3. Source Attribution
- Every synced event marked with source information:
  - Original calendar provider
  - Original calendar ID
  - Original event ID
  - Sync timestamp
  - User who initiated the sync
- Visual indicators in UI to show event origins
- Metadata preserved across sync operations

### 4. Conflict Resolution
- Automatic resolution strategies:
  - Last modified wins
  - Source calendar priority
  - User-defined rules
- Manual conflict resolution interface
- Conflict history logging
- Notification system for unresolved conflicts

### 5. Data Mapping and Transformation
- Field mapping between calendar providers:
  - Title/Subject
  - Description/Notes
  - Start/End times
  - Location
  - Attendees
  - Recurrence rules
  - Reminders/Alerts
- Custom field mapping for advanced users
- Data validation and sanitization

### 6. Sync Scheduling and Management
- Configurable sync intervals
- Background processing for large sync operations
- Sync status dashboard
- Pause/resume sync capabilities
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 7. User Interface Components
- Calendar connection wizard
- Sync settings panel
- Conflict resolution dialog
- Event origin indicators
- Sync status notifications

### 8. Security and Privacy
- Encrypted storage of calendar credentials
- Scoped permissions (read/write access)
- Data isolation between users
- Audit logs for sync operations

### 9. Performance and Scalability
- Efficient API usage with rate limiting
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Horizontal scaling support
- Background job queuing system

### 10. Analytics and Monitoring
- Sync success/failure metrics
- Performance monitoring
- User adoption tracking
- Error reporting and alerting

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js App Router)
- React components for calendar management
- Clerk.js integration for authentication
- Real-time updates using ConvexDB subscriptions

### Backend (ConvexDB + Next.js API Routes)
- ConvexDB for data storage and real-time sync
- API routes for calendar provider integrations
- Webhook handlers for real-time updates

### External Integrations
- Google Calendar API
- Microsoft Graph API
- CalDAV protocol support
- OAuth 2.0 flows

## Data Model
