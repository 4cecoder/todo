# Conflict Resolution Strategies

## Overview
Conflict resolution is critical for maintaining data integrity in a bidirectional sync system. This document outlines the strategies and mechanisms for handling conflicts between calendar events.

## Conflict Types

### 1. Simultaneous Modifications
- Same event modified in multiple calendars at overlapping times
- Changes to different fields vs. same fields
- Creation of duplicate events

### 2. Data Inconsistencies
- Different data formats between providers
- Missing or invalid field values
- Time zone discrepancies

### 3. Recurrence Conflicts
- Changes to recurring event instances
- Conflicting recurrence rules
- Exception handling in series

### 4. Permission Conflicts
- Read-only access to some calendars
- Partial sync permissions
- Authorization failures

## Resolution Strategies

### 1. Automatic Resolution

#### Last Modified Wins
- **Description**: The most recently modified version takes precedence
- **Implementation**: Compare `updated` timestamps across all sources
- **Pros**: Simple, deterministic
- **Cons**: May lose important changes
- **Use Case**: Default strategy for most users

#### Source Priority
- **Description**: Assign priority levels to calendar sources
- **Implementation**: User-configurable priority hierarchy
- **Pros**: User control over resolution
- **Cons**: Requires user configuration
- **Use Case**: Users with primary/secondary calendars

#### Field-Level Merge
- **Description**: Merge changes at the field level rather than event level
- **Implementation**: Compare individual fields and merge non-conflicting changes
- **Pros**: Preserves more data
- **Cons**: Complex logic, potential inconsistencies
- **Use Case**: Advanced users, non-overlapping field changes

### 2. Manual Resolution

#### User Choice Interface
- **Description**: Present conflict options to user for selection
- **Implementation**: Notification with side-by-side comparison
- **Pros**: User maintains control
- **Cons**: User friction, potential delays
- **Use Case**: High-value events, complex conflicts

#### Merge with Edit
- **Description**: Allow users to manually merge conflicting data
- **Implementation**: Editable merge interface with conflict highlighting
- **Pros**: Maximum user control
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, requires user expertise
- **Use Case**: Critical business events

### 3. Rule-Based Resolution

#### Custom Rules Engine
- **Description**: User-defined rules for automatic resolution
- **Implementation**: IF-THEN conditions based on event properties
- **Pros**: Automated, customizable
- **Cons**: Complex to set up
- **Use Case**: Organizations with standard processes

#### AI-Assisted Resolution
- **Description**: Use machine learning to suggest resolutions
- **Implementation**: Analyze conflict patterns and user preferences
- **Pros**: Learns from user behavior
- **Cons**: Requires training data, potential errors
- **Use Case**: Future enhancement

## Implementation Details

### Conflict Detection
```typescript
interface Conflict {
  eventId: string;
  sources: ConflictSource[];
  conflictType: 'modification' | 'creation' | 'deletion';
  conflictingFields: string[];
  timestamps: Date[];
}

interface ConflictSource {
  calendarId: string;
  eventData: EventData;
  lastModified: Date;
  userId: string;
}
```

### Resolution Engine
```typescript
class ConflictResolver {
  async resolve(conflict: Conflict): Promise<Resolution> {
    const strategy = await this.getResolutionStrategy(conflict);
    return await this.applyStrategy(conflict, strategy);
  }

  private async getResolutionStrategy(conflict: Conflict): Promise<Strategy> {
    // Check user preferences, global settings, conflict type
  }

  private async applyStrategy(conflict: Conflict, strategy: Strategy): Promise<Resolution> {
    // Apply the chosen resolution logic
  }
}
```

### Resolution Workflow
1. **Detection**: Identify conflicts during sync
2. **Analysis**: Gather all versions and metadata
3. **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate resolution method
4. **Application**: Apply resolution and update all sources
5. **Logging**: Record resolution for audit and learning
6. **Notification**: Inform user if manual intervention required

## User Experience

### Conflict Notification
- In-app notifications for pending conflicts
- Email alerts for critical conflicts
- Dashboard showing unresolved conflicts

### Resolution Interface
- Side-by-side comparison of conflicting versions
- Highlighted differences
- One-click resolution options
- Manual editing capabilities

### Settings and Preferences
- Default resolution strategy selection
- Per-calendar priority settings
- Notification preferences
- Advanced rule configuration

## Performance Considerations

### Efficiency
- Batch conflict resolution for multiple events
- Lazy loading of conflict details
- Caching of resolution preferences

### Scalability
- Distributed conflict resolution for high-volume users
- Queue-based processing for complex conflicts
- Rate limiting for manual resolutions

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics
- Conflict rate per user/calendar
- Resolution time distribution
- Strategy effectiveness rates
- User satisfaction with resolutions

### Logging
- Detailed conflict logs for debugging
- Resolution history for auditing
- Performance metrics for optimization

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Unresolvable Conflicts
- Escalation to manual resolution
- Temporary conflict quarantine
- Administrator notification for systemic issues

### Data Loss Prevention
- Backup of conflicting versions
- Undo functionality for resolutions
- Version history preservation

### Network and API Failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed resolutions
- Offline conflict queuing
- Partial resolution handling

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual resolution strategy testing
- Conflict detection algorithm validation
- Edge case handling verification

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end conflict scenarios
- Multi-calendar conflict resolution
- User interface testing

### Load Tests
- High-volume conflict processing
- Concurrent resolution handling
- Performance under stress

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Predictive conflict resolution
- Group conflict resolution
- Integration with external conflict resolution services

### Machine Learning
- Pattern recognition for common conflicts
- Automated rule generation
- Resolution quality improvement

This comprehensive approach to conflict resolution ensures data integrity while providing flexibility for different user needs and preferences.
