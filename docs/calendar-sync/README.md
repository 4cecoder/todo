# Calendar Sync Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive planning documentation for the bilinear (bidirectional) calendar sync system with multi-calendar integration.

## Overview

The calendar sync system enables seamless bidirectional synchronization of events across multiple calendar providers while maintaining source attribution for all cloned events. Built on Next.js, Vercel, ConvexDB, and Clerk.js.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Calendar Integration**: Support for Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and CalDAV providers
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Real-time two-way synchronization of events
- **Source Attribution**: All synced events marked with original source information
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple strategies for handling synchronization conflicts
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Real-time, periodic, and manual sync options
- **Data Mapping**: Comprehensive field mapping and transformation between providers

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Clerk.js for authentication
- React components for calendar management
- Real-time updates via ConvexDB

### Backend
- ConvexDB for data storage and sync
- Next.js API routes for integrations
- Webhook handlers for real-time sync
- Background jobs for periodic operations

### External Integrations
- Google Calendar API v3
- Microsoft Graph API
- CalDAV protocol
- OAuth 2.0 authentication

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-4): Basic infrastructure and one-way sync
2. **Bidirectional Sync** (Weeks 5-8): Two-way sync and source attribution
3. **Multi-Calendar** (Weeks 9-12): Multiple providers and advanced conflicts
4. **Optimization** (Weeks 13-16): Performance and advanced features
5. **Launch Prep** (Weeks 17-20): Polish, testing, and production readiness

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Database**: ConvexDB for real-time capabilities and easy scaling
- **Authentication**: Clerk.js for seamless user management and OAuth
- **Hosting**: Vercel for serverless deployment and global CDN
- **Sync Strategy**: Combination of webhooks, scheduled jobs, and manual triggers
- **Conflict Resolution**: User-configurable strategies with automatic fallbacks

## Success Metrics

- Sync accuracy >99%
- User adoption >70% of active users
- Performance <30s average sync time
- NPS >50 post-launch

## Getting Started
